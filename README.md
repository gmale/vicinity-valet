**Valet** *[va-ley]* | *noun* : an attendant who performs personal services

---
A mobile device knows a lot about its digital environment. It should leverage that in order to make life easier. As my home becomes more digitized with ZWave devices and Kevo locks and smart things, I want my phone to take care of the obvious.

If my phone knows it is night time when I walk into a room, why can't the lights turn on? Why do I have to lift a finger to unlock my door? This app begins by trying to answer these simple questions and builds from there.

For now, it is intended for personal use. If I can build it in a way that would help others, I will.
